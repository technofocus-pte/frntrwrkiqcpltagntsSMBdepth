**Estimated Duration:** 40 minutes

**Lab Overview**

In this lab, you'll use Planner Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot to review
project plans, identify risks, generate executive summaries, assign
follow-up work, and coordinate peak season readiness across multiple
teams.

**Scenario**

**Zava Retail** is a rapidly growing omnichannel retailer that serves
customers through its e-commerce platform and a network of more
than **50 retail stores**. As the business has expanded, so has the
complexity of coordinating store operations, inventory, marketing
campaigns, workforce readiness, and supplier activities across multiple
locations.

To prepare for the upcoming holiday shopping season, Zava Retail has
launched the **Peak Season Readiness Program**. The initiative brings
together Store Operations, Workforce Readiness, Marketing, and Inventory
teams to coordinate activities, track progress, and ensure every store
is ready before the busiest shopping period begins.

**Priya Nair**, the Regional Operations Manager, is responsible for
overseeing the program and ensuring every workstream stays on schedule.
Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of tasks across multiple buckets,
Priya uses **Microsoft 365 Copilot Planner Agent** to quickly assess
project health, identify overdue or high-priority work, summarize
progress, and recommend next steps.

In this lab, you'll step into Priya's role and use Planner Agent to
monitor the Peak Season Readiness Program, uncover potential risks, and
make informed operational decisions that help ensure every store is
ready for the busiest shopping season of the year.
